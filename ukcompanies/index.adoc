== Import

Be sure to enable multi statement query editor in Neo4j Browser, then run:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (c:Company) ASSERT c.companyNumber IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT (p.birthMonth, p.birthYear, p.name ) IS NODE KEY;
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Property) ASSERT p.titleNumber IS UNIQUE;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://guides.neo4j.com/ukcompanies/data/PSCAmericans.csv" AS row
MERGE (c:Company {companyNumber: row.company_number})
MERGE (p:Person {name: row.`data.name`, birthYear: row.`data.date_of_birth.year`, birthMonth: row.`data.date_of_birth.month`})
ON CREATE SET p.nationality = row.`data.nationality`,
              p.countryOfResidence = row.`data.country_of_residence`
              // TODO: Address

MERGE (p)-[r:HAS_CONTROL]->(c)
SET r.nature = split(replace(replace(replace(row.`data.natures_of_control`, "[",""),"]",""),  '"', ""), ",")
RETURN COUNT(*);

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://guides.neo4j.com/ukcompanies/data/CompanyDataAmericans.csv" AS row
MATCH (c:Company {companyNumber: row.` CompanyNumber`})
SET c.name = row.CompanyName,

    c.incorporationDate = Date(Datetime({epochSeconds: apoc.date.parse(row.IncorporationDate,'s','dd/MM/yyyy')})),
    c.SIC = row.`SICCode.SicText_1`,

MERGE (c)-[r:DONATED {ref: row.ECRef}]->(p)
SET r.date  = Date(Datetime({epochSeconds: apoc.date.parse(row.ReceivedDate,'s','dd/MM/yyyy')})),
    r.value = toFloat(replace(replace(row.Value, "Â£", ""), ",", ""));

CALL db.schema();

== Querying With `MATCH`

Now that we've imported our data it's time to query it!

In Neo4j we use the `MATCH` command to query data. The syntax is `MATCH`, followed by a graph pattern. For example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Margery Kraus"})
RETURN p
----


* The `()` represent a node
* `:Person` is the node label
* `{}` indicate properties
* `{name: ""}`
* `p` becomes a variable that is bound to pieces of the graph that match the pattern
* We use `RETURN` to return data and visualize the results

== Querying With `MATCH` - Exercise

Now it's your turn!

* Find the `Person` node with the name `Michael Rubens Bloomberg`
* Find the `Company` with the name `GRAPHIC PLC`

Remember the basic format for `MATCH`:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (variable:NodeLabel {property: "value"})
RETURN variable
----

== Querying With `MATCH` - Answers

Find the `Person` node with the name `Michael Rubens Bloomberg`

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Michael Rubens Bloomberg"})
RETURN p
----

Find the `Company` with the name `GRAPHIC PLC`

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Company {name: "GRAPHIC PLC"})
RETURN c
----


== Using Relationships

Nodes are connected by relationships. We can define more complex graph patterns that include relationships in our `MATCH` statements using square brackets `[]` to define the relationship. For example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Margery Kraus"})-[:HAS_CONTROL]->(c:Company)
RETURN p, c
----

* Note the `-[:HAS_CONTROL]->` pattern


== Using Relationships - Exercise

* Can you find the companies connected to Michael Rubens Bloomberg?
* Do these companies connected to Michael Ruben Bloomberg own any properties?
* Did these companies connected to Michael Ruben Bloomberg make any political donations?

== Using Relationships - Answers

Companies connected to Michael Rubens Bloomberg?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Michael Rubens Bloomberg"})-[:HAS_CONTROL]->(c:Company)
RETURN p, c
----

Do these companies own any properties?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Michael Rubens Bloomberg"})-[:HAS_CONTROL]->(c:Company)-[:OWNS]->(pr:Property)
RETURN p, c, pr
----

Did these companies make any political donations?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Michael Rubens Bloomberg"})-[:HAS_CONTROL]->(c:Company)-[:DONATED]->(r:Recipient)
RETURN p, c, r
----

== Fuzzy Matches

We've seen how to do exact comparisons, but what about "fuzzy" matches? For example, what if we didn't know Michael Bloomberg's middle name? Or wanted to take slight misspellings into account?

We have a few options for non-exact matches:

* `CONTAINS`
* Case in-sensitive
* Regular expressions
* True fuzzy match with a full text index

== Fuzzy Matches - `CONTAINS`

The `CONTAINS` string comparison operator can be used to match on strings that contain sub-strings.

To take advantage of `CONTAINS` we need to introduce the `WHERE` clause. We can use any boolean expression in a `WHERE` clause to filter matches. For example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "Bloomberg"
RETURN p
----

== Fuzzy Matches - Regular Expression

We can also use regular expressions 

This is equivilent to using a `CONTAINS`:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name =~ ".*Bloomberg.*"
----

We can also do case insensitive:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Company)
WHERE c.name =~ "(?i)grahic.*"
RETURN c
----

See the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Regular Expression docs^] for more examples.

== Fuzzy Matches - Full Text Index

A full text index can help us make true fuzzy comparisons - taking into account mispellings.

== Fuzzy Matches - Exercise

1) Contains

Find Abagail Johnson and any companies she is connected to. Hint: The data might contain title prefixing names (Mr, Mrs, Ms, etc) so we'll need to take that intro account.

2) Regular expression



3) Full text index
