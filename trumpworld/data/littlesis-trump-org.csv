This does not count money donated to dark money political nonprofits.

Common Cause analyzed the 2014 political spending of members of the U.S. Business Coalition for TPP, a group of over 150 corporations and trade associations pushing for the TPP, which includes the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), and Trade Promotion Authority (fast track). The coalition spending has also continued after the 2014 elections.
The Guardian previously reported that members of this same coalition spent $1.14 million on campaign contributions to US Senate campaigns between January and March 2015.

Through its history, the Bank has proven to be a dynamic institution, with the flexibility and creativity required to generate alternative solutions to the island’s ever-changing needs.

During the early years, the Bank intervened directly in Puerto Rico’s development investing in projects that were needed to get the economy moving but which private investors found too risky. In its later years, GDB has emerged as a promoter and facilitator, helping to create a favorable environment for private sector investments that will generate economic growth.

The Bank has been the catalytic agent in Puerto Rico’s transformation from an agrarian framework into an economy that is competitive in multiple and diverse areas. From promoting, during a specific time in history, an ‘entrepreneur government,’ it came to understand that the government’s role should be more that of a facilitator of processes for private enterprise.

Act 252 of May 13, 1942 of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico created GDB “for the purpose of carrying out the complete development of Puerto Rico’s human and economic resources.” But the Bank would not acquire its final form until the enactment of Act 272 of May 15, 1945, which authorized it to act as fiscal agent and financial advisor of the central government and its agencies; and Act 17 of September 23, 1948, which includes the Charter of the Bank and established all of its duties and powers.

Initially, GDB was little more than a section of the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury with a mere handful of employees. Today, the Bank is one of the island’s most important and prestigious institutions, with total assets of $8.9 billion and 514 employees.

As now constituted, the Bank’s primary functions are to act as a fiscal agent and financial advisor for the Commonwealth and its agencies and to provide financing mechanisms to both public entities and private enterprises in order to boost the island’s economic development. Throughout its history the Bank has undertaken ventures that go well beyond the boundaries we normally identify with banking institutions. When circumstances require it, the Bank has pioneered in breaking new ground to advance Puerto Rico’s economic and social development.

Undoubtedly, GDB has been one of the engines of our economic development. It financed the first efforts of our government to promote industrialization, the first restorations, the first condominiums, the first office buildings, the first hotels, and the first bond issues of our public corporations and municipalities. It has contributed to the creation of job opportunities for our families. And as a fiscal agent, it has been instrumental in the task of providing our country with the infrastructure required to facilitate our economic development.",Org

We also supervise the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. Our goal in supervising banks and federal savings associations is to ensure that they operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with laws requiring fair treatment of their customers and fair access to credit and financial products.
The OCC is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The President, with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, appoints the Comptroller to head the agency for a five-year term. The Comptroller also is a director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and NeighborWorks® America.
Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the OCC has four district offices plus an office in London to supervise the international activities of national banks. The OCC's nationwide staff of bank examiners conducts on-site reviews of national banks and federal savings associations (or federal thrifts) and provides sustained supervision of these institutions’ operations. Examiners analyze loan and investment portfolios, funds management, capital, earnings, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk for all national banks and federal thrifts, and compliance with consumer banking laws for national banks and thrifts with less than $10 billion in assets. They review internal controls, internal and external audit, and compliance with law. They also evaluate management's ability to identify and control risk.
In regulating national banks and federal thrifts, the OCC has the power to:
Examine the national banks and federal thrifts.
Approve or deny applications for new charters, branches, capital, or other changes in corporate or banking structure.
Take supervisory actions against national banks and federal thrifts that do not comply with laws and regulations or that otherwise engage in unsound practices. Remove officers and directors, negotiate agreements to change banking practices, and issue cease and desist orders as well as civil money penalties.
Issue rules and regulations, legal interpretations, and corporate decisions governing investments, lending, and other practices.
OCC Funding
The OCC does not receive appropriations from Congress. Instead, the OCC's operations are funded primarily by assessments on national banks and federal savings associations. National banks and federal thrifts pay for their examinations, and they pay for the OCC's processing of their corporate applications. The OCC also receives revenue from its investment income, primarily from U.S. Treasury securities.
The OCC's Objectives
The OCC's activities are predicated on four objectives that support the agency's mission to ensure a stable and competitive national system of banks and savings associations:
Ensure the safety and soundness of the national system of banks and savings associations.
Foster competition by allowing banks to offer new products and services.
Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of OCC supervision, including reducing regulatory burden.
Ensure fair and equal access to financial services for all Americans.
By law, the OCC is prohibited from releasing information from its safety and soundness examinations to the public. National banks and federal savings associations must, however, submit regular reports of their condition and income to the FDIC, available on its Web site.
Help for Customers of National Banks and Federal Savings Associations at HelpWithMyBank.gov
In July 2007, the OCC launched www.HelpWithMyBank.gov to assist customers of national banks and federal savings associations. HelpWithMyBank.gov provides answers to common banking questions. If you have a complaint about a national bank or federal savings association, the site also provides a means to filing that complaint online.
Minority Bankers
Recognizing the important role that minority-owned banks and savings associations play in addressing financial services needs in the communities they serve, the OCC is committed to encouraging the success of these financial institutions.

The Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, sec. 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 (1789) created the Office of the Attorney General. Originally a one-person part-time position, the Attorney General was to be ""learned in the law"" with the duty ""to prosecute and conduct all suits in the Supreme Court in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the President of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments, touching any matters that may concern their departments."" The workload quickly became too much for one person, necessitating the hiring of several assistants for the Attorney General. With an increasing amount of work to be done, private attorneys were retained to work on cases.

In 1870, after the post-Civil War increase in the amount of litigation involving the United States necessitated the very expensive retention of a large number of private attorneys to handle the workload, a concerned Congress passed the Act to Establish the Department of Justice, ch. 150, 16 Stat. 162 (1870) setting it up as ""an executive department of the government of the United States"" with the Attorney General as its head. Officially coming into existence on July 1, 1870, the Department of Justice, pursuant to the 1870 Act, was to handle the legal business of the United States. The Act gave the Department control over all criminal prosecutions and civil suits in which the United States had an interest. In addition, the Act gave the Attorney General and the Department control over federal law enforcement. To assist the Attorney General, the 1870 Act created the Office of the Solicitor General.

The 1870 Act is the foundation upon which the Department of Justice still rests. However, the structure of the Department of Justice has changed over the years, with the addition of the Deputy Attorneys General and the formation of the Divisions. Unchanged is the steadily increasing workload of the Department. It has become the world's largest law office and the central agency for enforcement of federal laws.",Org

The Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, sec. 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 (1789) created the Office of the Attorney General. Originally a one-person part-time position, the Attorney General was to be ""learned in the law"" with the duty ""to prosecute and conduct all suits in the Supreme Court in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the President of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments, touching any matters that may concern their departments."" The workload quickly became too much for one person, necessitating the hiring of several assistants for the Attorney General. With an increasing amount of work to be done, private attorneys were retained to work on cases.

In 1870, after the post-Civil War increase in the amount of litigation involving the United States necessitated the very expensive retention of a large number of private attorneys to handle the workload, a concerned Congress passed the Act to Establish the Department of Justice, ch. 150, 16 Stat. 162 (1870) setting it up as ""an executive department of the government of the United States"" with the Attorney General as its head. Officially coming into existence on July 1, 1870, the Department of Justice, pursuant to the 1870 Act, was to handle the legal business of the United States. The Act gave the Department control over all criminal prosecutions and civil suits in which the United States had an interest. In addition, the Act gave the Attorney General and the Department control over federal law enforcement. To assist the Attorney General, the 1870 Act created the Office of the Solicitor General.

The 1870 Act is the foundation upon which the Department of Justice still rests. However, the structure of the Department of Justice has changed over the years, with the addition of the Deputy Attorneys General and the formation of the Divisions. Unchanged is the steadily increasing workload of the Department. It has become the world's largest law office and the central agency for enforcement of federal laws.",Org

His father worked in Chicago's stockyards for 33 years. His mother was a homemaker.  He obtained an Associate of Arts degree from Joliet Junior College in 1973, and in 1975 he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Eastern Illinois University.  He continued his education to earn a Master’s degree in Public Administration from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1988, and pursued post- graduate studies at Northwestern University in Public Safety Administration.

In 1977, Willie became a Chicago Police Officer and he retired from law enforcement in 2003 after 26 years of dedicated service as a patrolman, investigator, sergeant and federal marshal.  After retiring from the police department, Willie went on to demonstrate his commitment to community service by working as organizer for the Woodlawn's New Communities Program. During his tenure as a community organizer, he participated in extensive community planning activities designed to improve the quality of life and create solutions to problems that have plagued neighborhoods, such as crime, ineffective schools, and lack of affordable housing, jobs, health, and economic development.  He has directed the same type of quality of life initiative in the Washington Park community. He also led the development of its New Communities Program, the Washington Park Consortium, and ensured that a quality of life plan was undertaken in the Back of the Yards community. In addition to being an active resident of the community, he operated a family owned business in Woodlawn for 14 years.

In 2007, Willie B. Cochran was elected Alderman of the 20th Ward, and in 2008 he was also elected Ward Committeeman.  In 2011 he was re-elected to his second term as Alderman of the 20th Ward, and he was also re-elected Ward Committeeman in 2012.

His work to address public safety in the 46th Ward has helped bring crime down to historic lows. On the City level, he has focused on improving the delivery of services by advocating for the use of outcome metrics to measure the performance of various city departments and social services to ensure greater efficiency and use of their limited resources. James also serves on the Budget, Ethics, Health, Housing, Licensing & Consumer Protection, Pedestrian & Traffic, and Zoning Committees.

In addition to his work in the 46th Ward, James continues to advocate for families throughout the city as an active board member of Annie’s Legacy, a Southside not-for-profit organization that empowers women who have experienced abuse and poverty  . In 1987, he co-founded a homeless shelter that provided care for people living with HIV/AIDS and for three years served as chair of the Illinois’ National Association of Social Workers’ HIV Task Force. A licensed clinical social worker, James has worked in the healthcare field to improve communication among doctors, patients, and families. He also has had training in research that focused on improving the delivery of healthcare. Prior to his election as Alderman in 2011, he was active with the Uptown Chicago Commission and served two terms as their board president.

She has an extensive background in urban planning and community development and was one of the primary architects of the Bronzeville Development Plan - which won a Burnham Award for excellence in planning. She is a former City Planner and Deputy Commissioner of Neighborhood Planning under former Mayors Harold Washington, Eugene Sawyer and Richard Daley. Formerly, Ms. Dowell was the executive director of the Near West Side Community Development Corporation where she built affordable housing and commercial retail space and provided social services and employment and financial counseling services to residents of Henry Horner Homes. In the mid 1990’s, she was the founding executive director of the Mid-South Planning and Development Commission and as a result of her leadership millions of dollars in development funding was allocated to the ward to preserve several historic Bronzeville landmarks. Finally, she was executive director of Chicago Public Allies, a national youth development organization.
Ms. Dowell has a B.A. degree in Developmental Psychology from the University of Rochester and a Masters Degree in Social Service Administration from the University of Chicago. In the City Council, Alderman Dowell will be a member of the Housing and Real Estate, Transportation and the Public Way, Landmarks, Rules and Health Committees.",Person
"DLA PIPER",16112,NULL,"Campaign Contribution",Donation,"DANIEL SOLIS",159808,"In 1996, Daniel “Danny” Solis was appointed Alderman in Chicago’s City Council by Mayor Richard M. Daley following the indictment of his predecessor. His years of public service as Alderman of the 25th Ward has been made possible by the voting constituency to serve as a voice and leader for the community comprised of Pilsen, Heart of Chicago, Little Italy, Chinatown and UIC/West Loop. This year, he celebrated his 16th anniversary in Chicago’s City Council.

Through his tenure, Alderman Solis has also received special City Council appointments as President Pro Tempore (2001-2009) and Chairman of the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards (2009-current). As the voted Chair of the Hispanic Caucus by fellow Hispanic aldermen, his experience enables him to promote strong representation of the Hispanic community in the new City Council and with Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Solis also played a major role in the ward remap negotiations based on 2010 U.S. Census figures.

Born in Monterrey, Mexico, Alderman Solis immigrated to the United States when he was seven years old with his family to the Lower West Side area of Chicago, and attended St. Mel High School and the University of Illinois at Chicago. He began his career as a community organizer and then entered the classroom as a teacher. Inspired by increasing educational opportunities for his community and populations most at risk — minorities and youth — Alderman Solis assumed a leadership role as Founder and Executive Director of the Latino Youth Alternative High School (LYHS) to address the problem of high dropout rates among children in the Pilsen/Little Village community. Subsequently, he became the first Latino Executive Director of the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council, served on the Board of Directors for the Eighteenth Street Development Corporation and Gads Hill Center. These first career experiences greatly influenced Solis’ desire to spearhead larger legislative campaigns and see through major policy wins.

Undoubtedly, Alderman Solis is a key figure in Chicago’s political landscape. His leadership as Co-Founder and Executive Director of the United Neighborhood Organization (UNO) led to Solis’ most significant and successful grassroots, legislation-driven campaigns within Chicago’s communities in history: The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) campaign that allowed thousands of undocumented immigrants to seek amnesty as U.S. residents, and the historic 1992 naturalization campaign that eventually assisted over 50,000 immigrants in applying for U.S. citizenship. These policy initiatives became model programs not only in Chicago, but across the nation. In 1995, Solis was appointed as Chairman of Mayor Daley’s Citizenship Assistance Council, which oversaw the naturalization for over 70,000 immigrants from around the world. Solis also led educational reforms for the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) by helping organize a campaign to enlist parents and community members to run in the first Local School Council (LSC) elections.

Alderman Solis has pioneered and negotiated major community economic developments and infrastructure enhancements, leading to increased employment opportunities, strengthened cultural foundations, advanced educational institutions, sustainability initiatives through environment and transit, and capital contributions for the 25th Ward such as:

International Produce Market and American Linen Company to stay and/or locate in the 25th Wards Planned Manufacturing District (PMD)
Ping Tom Memorial Park
City’s first green street
Closure of the Fisk Coal Power Plant
Marijuana Ordinance
18th Street Protected Bike Lane
Today, Alderman Solis continues to represent Pilsen, home of the National Museum of Mexican Art; creative-cultural hubs; the West Loop area near the prestigious University of Illinois’ Chicago campus; and Chicago’s fast-growing Chinatown community. He resides in the Tri-Taylor community and has four children and three beautiful grandchildren. During his free time, Alderman Solis enjoys bike riding with his son, catching up on movies and taking salsa dance lessons.",Person

Berman’s government service helped establish him as one of Washington’s quietly influential insiders on both domestic and foreign policy. President George Bush appointed Berman Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Policy in January 1989, a post from which he was the principal adviser to the Secretary of Commerce, served as the official US liaison to foreign business groups and oversaw more than 60 projects that resulted in new export orders for US goods.

Berman spent his time out of government building his own business and managing others. He is the founder of Berman Enterprises, a lobbying and business consulting firm, which merged with Ogilvy Government Relations in January 2004. He is the Vice Chairman of JLT America, a London based international insurance brokerage. In the early 1990s, he served as a managing partner of America Mercantile Group, a private merchant bank. And he was the managing partner of a Washington consulting firm from 1985 to 1988.

Berman has played a substantive political role in just about every Republican presidential campaign of the last generation. He was a senior advisor to the Bush/Cheney transition in 2001, the vice presidential campaign director for Dole/Kemp and deputy director of the Republican National Convention in 1996, director of congressional relations during the Bush/Quayle campaign in 1988 and a deputy director of the Bush/Reagan transition team in 1981. He has served in a variety of fundraising capacities in every Republican presidential race since 1992.

Berman has served on the board of trustees for the Library of Congress, the Center for Strategic and International Studies as well as the Center for the Study of the Presidency and helped lead campaigns for So Others May Eat, (SOME). He has appeared on CNN and CNBC.

As Congress considered “fast track” measures giving President Obama authority to approve the largest trade deal in history, a review of public records indicates the corporate alliance supporting the proposed TPP spent at least $658 million on federal lobbying in 2014 and political action in the 2014 cycle. This does not count money donated to dark money political nonprofits.

Common Cause analyzed the 2014 political spending of members of the U.S. Business Coalition for TPP, a group of over 150 corporations and trade associations pushing for the TPP, which includes the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), and Trade Promotion Authority (fast track). The coalition spending has also continued after the 2014 elections.
The Guardian previously reported that members of this same coalition spent $1.14 million on campaign contributions to US Senate campaigns between January and March 2015.

"AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE",40360,NULL,Grant,Donation,"NATIONAL FISH AND WILDLIFE FOUNDATION",50284,"Created by Congress in 1984, NFWF directs public conservation dollars to the most pressing environmental needs and matches those investments with private funds. The Foundation’s method is simple and effective: we work with a full complement of individuals, foundations, government agencies, nonprofits, and corporations to identify and fund the nation’s most intractable conservation challenges.

Strategy

As no two issues are exactly alike, NFWF doesn’t rely on a set formula to protect and restore our Nation’s natural resources. We are creative and pragmatic, employing a wide array of conservation tactics to meet our mission. From purchasing land to teaching cranes to migrate, from creating incentive driven markets to address river restoration and environmental water needs to eradicating invasive species, the impact of NFWF’s contribution can be felt across the country.

NFWF’s partnerships are key to its success. Sitting at the nexus of the public and private communities, the Foundation’s myriad partnerships connect it with potentially every federal and state agency, key industry leaders, concerned private citizens, and non-profit leaders from the international to the local level. And the results speak for themselves. Since its establishment, NFWF has awarded over 10,000 grants to more than 3,500 organizations in the United States and abroad and leveraged – with its partners – more than $600 million into over $1.5 billion for conservation.

Keystone Programs

Our Keystone Programs represent NFWF’s core portfolio of conservation initiatives and demonstrate our commitment to making measurable progress in restoring at-risk species. We operate four Keystone Programs: birds, freshwater fish, wildlife and habitat, and marine and coastal ecosystems. Led by our team of PhD scientists, these Keystones address the challenges facing key endangered, threatened, or declining species that are indicators for overall ecosystem health. Success in restoring these populations will demonstrate measurable progress in protecting crucial landscapes and watersheds.

Charter Programs

Consistent with the legislation passed by Congress creating the Foundation, we have partnerships with a number of federal agencies, corporations, and others to increase funding for conservation. Through these partnerships, the Foundation establishes Charter grant programs that address specific conservation needs, often in restricted geographic areas.

IDEA Program

A key component of the Foundation's approach to conservation investment is the Impact-Directed Environmental Account (IDEA) program. The IDEA program receives, manages, and disburses funds that originate from court orders, settlements of legal cases, regulatory permits, licenses, and restoration and mitigation plans. However, IDEA funds can also arise from voluntary activities focused on preventative conservation.

Through the IDEA program, the Foundation acts as a neutral third-party fiduciary to manage funds for the benefit of government and private-sector stakeholders. The Foundation works collaboratively with these partners to invest and grow designated monies while at the same time helping to ensure that the funds are applied - typically at the direction of the designated stakeholders - to the most effective conservation and restoration projects.

Specifically, NFWF provides account management services, plus assistance with: project solicitation and selection, negotiation and administration of contracts and grant agreements, identification of leveraging opportunities, and evaluation of project outcomes.

Success Stories
NFWF has an impressive conservation track record: in 25 years, we have awarded over 10,000 grants to 3,500 organizations in the US and abroad. Several underlying principles guide our work: we forge innovative public and private-sector partnerships that bring expertise and resources to each project; we develop pioneering solutions to conservation challenges; and we work at the local level to address the root causes of habitat loss and species decline. Below are examples of model projects that illustrate our approach and accomplishments.",Org

There were nine advisors and nine official observers. The Council was funded by a grant from EPA. At the first Council meeting all participants were invited to the table and the stakeholder process was established.  This Council was charged with developing guidelines for state oil and gas exploration and production waste regulatory programs.
In early 1990 the Council produced the 1990 Guidelines.  The 1990 Guidelines were organized by subject matter. They established environmental objectives for state regulatory programs. Fundamental differences exist from state to state, and within regions within a state in terms of climate, hydrology, geology, economics, and methods of operation.  Consequently, regulatory programs vary in order to accommodate the differences in state administrative procedures, laws, and regulatory history. The Guidelines were used as a basis for state reviews.
In 1993 the Guidelines were updated and revised to include abandoned sites and naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). Follow-up reviews to document changes resulting from recommendations contained in reports of initial reviews were initiated.  
In 1999, State Review of Oil and Natural Gas Environmental Regulations (STRONGER) was formed to manage the state review process. STRONGER received funding from EPA, DOE and API. The 1994 Guidelines were revised in 2000, 2005 and 2010. Important additions were Spill Prevention, Performance Measures to evaluate how well state programs achieve their goals, Stormwater Management, and Hydraulic Fracturing. In 2013 the Hydraulic Fracturing Guidelines were updated, and in 2014 a new section on Air Quality was added to the Guidelines. STRONGER is currently developing a new Guidlines section on Fluids Recycling, to be released in early 2015.",Org

The Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, sec. 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 (1789) created the Office of the Attorney General. Originally a one-person part-time position, the Attorney General was to be ""learned in the law"" with the duty ""to prosecute and conduct all suits in the Supreme Court in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the President of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments, touching any matters that may concern their departments."" The workload quickly became too much for one person, necessitating the hiring of several assistants for the Attorney General. With an increasing amount of work to be done, private attorneys were retained to work on cases.

In 1870, after the post-Civil War increase in the amount of litigation involving the United States necessitated the very expensive retention of a large number of private attorneys to handle the workload, a concerned Congress passed the Act to Establish the Department of Justice, ch. 150, 16 Stat. 162 (1870) setting it up as ""an executive department of the government of the United States"" with the Attorney General as its head. Officially coming into existence on July 1, 1870, the Department of Justice, pursuant to the 1870 Act, was to handle the legal business of the United States. The Act gave the Department control over all criminal prosecutions and civil suits in which the United States had an interest. In addition, the Act gave the Attorney General and the Department control over federal law enforcement. To assist the Attorney General, the 1870 Act created the Office of the Solicitor General.

The 1870 Act is the foundation upon which the Department of Justice still rests. However, the structure of the Department of Justice has changed over the years, with the addition of the Deputy Attorneys General and the formation of the Divisions. Unchanged is the steadily increasing workload of the Department. It has become the world's largest law office and the central agency for enforcement of federal laws.",Org

This does not count money donated to dark money political nonprofits.

Common Cause analyzed the 2014 political spending of members of the U.S. Business Coalition for TPP, a group of over 150 corporations and trade associations pushing for the TPP, which includes the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), and Trade Promotion Authority (fast track). The coalition spending has also continued after the 2014 elections.
The Guardian previously reported that members of this same coalition spent $1.14 million on campaign contributions to US Senate campaigns between January and March 2015.

A skilled problem solver, he has spent more than a decade resolving client issues through the legislative, regulatory and procurement process at various levels of government. 

CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, association heads, college presidents and not-for-profit organizations have relied upon Sam’s sage counsel and experience in government to help them better position their organizations to reach their business goals. His background and reputation have earned Sam the unique ability to effectively lobby both sides of the political aisle for the firm’s clients. 

Prior to joining Wilson Elser, Sam spent six years helping to turn an upstart lobbying firm into a top-tier company. He has been a political consultant to both the National Democratic Committee and the New York State Democratic Committee. Sam started his legal career in the Office of Corporation Counsel for former Deputy HUD Secretary and Syracuse Mayor Roy Bernardi.

Areas of Focus

Government Relations 
Sam is an experienced lobbyist in New York State, New York City and federal government. He has served a wide range of clients, including various municipal governments; the home health care industry; the ambulance industry; hospitals; the racing and gaming industry; the energy industry; and matters pertaining to architects, engineers and construction companies. Sam also is the face of the New York City Real Estate Industry in Albany, representing both the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) and SL Green, Manhattan’s largest commercial landlord. 

Sam started the firm’s procurement lobbying practice in 2007 to assist clients seeking to do business with various levels of government in New York State. With the firm’s guidance and representation, clients have been successful in securing many high-profile, sought-after public contracts, including the current renovation of the New York State Capitol. 

In recent years, Sam has been tapped by entities to revive initiatives that had stalled in the State legislative process for years. Despite the tough economy, Sam successfully lobbied the State Legislature and Governor to enact legislation providing tax incentives for the renovation of historic properties, an initiative that had failed for several years prior to Wilson Elser’s involvement. Similarly, in 2011, he secured enactment of another piece of difficult legislation, allowing a state university to privately develop portions of its land. This initiative had been vetoed and stalled prior to Sam’s engagement. 

Sam is an adjunct professor at The Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at SUNY Albany, teaching a course on New York State government, the law and lobbying.

Since the Harvard/Kennedy School Health Care Delivery Policy Program was created seven years ago, the exposure of the present American health care delivery system as unsustainable due to its unsafe character, low quality, and steeply rising cost has made it the primary domestic issue demanding reform.  Much of the debate on system reform centers on the balance between the roles of business and government. 

Three times a year, HCDP gathers 20 senior executives from all sectors of health care delivery to debate nearly every aspect of America’s highly complex and dysfunctional health care delivery system. HCDP works to develop options for systemic transformation that the group’s members subsequently introduce to the market.  

HCDP’s director, Jerome H. Grossman, M.D., is leading three  efforts to bring these general ideas to the public. He coauthored the joint National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine (NAE/IOM) report, Building a Better Delivery System; the Committee on Economic Development (CED) report, The Employer-Based Health Insurance System is Failing — What We Must Do About It; and a forthcoming book co-authored with Clay Christensen and Jason Hwang on the impact of disruptive technology on health care. HCDP affiliate Karen Eggleston, with participation of Joseph Newhouse and Ernie Berndt, has also advanced research on productivity in diabetes treatment.

In addition to their formal meetings, the Health Care Delivery Policy group works to regularly present and update information central to research on delivery system reform. Cara Helfner, HCDP’s Medical Librarian/Research Associate, has developed and maintained the program’s multifaceted website, which includes presentations made by group speakers, a synopsis of HCDP’s projects and research, and The Numbers — a particularly in-depth resource that collects and analyzes data ranging from the total population of the United States to the number of individuals insured, by types of coverage. HCDP also issues reports on healthcare cost estimates, a volume of the fifteen leading chronic medical conditions, and insurance coverage by income quintile. All provided information has extensive bibliographies and is continually updated.With the 2008 election fast approaching, HCDP has become an increasingly essential resource for anyone concerned with healthcare reform as a political issue.",Org

Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC; Schweizerischer Bankverein, Société de Banque Suisse, Società di Banca Svizzera) was founded in 1872 under the name Basler Bankverein, and had its registered office in Basel. In 1897 the bank changed its name to Schweizerischer Bankverein. SBC opened its first branch abroad in London as early as 1898, an indication of its early emphasis on foreign operations. The New York agency was opened in 1939. Although the bank opened branches in other regions of Switzerland at the start of the 20th century, its major nationwide expansion followed only in the 1960's.

In 1945 SBC took over the troubled Basler Handelsbank, one of Switzerland’s big banks, founded in 1862. Within Switzerland, SBC traded as a so-called universal bank with distinctively Swiss characteristics, with domestic corporate and retail clients and asset management; whereas abroad, it concentrated mainly on commercial banking for corporate clients. In the last decade of the twentieth century, SBC strengthened its international orientation again by taking over foreign finance firms (1995: O’Connor & Associates, Chicago; Brinson Partners, Inc., Chicago; S.G. Warburg plc, London).

Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS; Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft, Union de Banques Suisses, Unione di Banche Svizzere) was created in 1912 by the merger of two regional banks: Toggenburger Bank, founded in 1863, and Bank in Winterthur (1862). After World War One, UBS gained a foothold in several Swiss cantons by taking over numerous banks and setting up its own branches, also turning to foreign business. The years of crisis that followed had far-reaching effects on UBS. In 1945 the bank moved its registered office to Zurich and acquired Eidgenössische Bank (1862), one of Switzerland’s big banks, which was in difficulties at the time. Only after the war did the first steps abroad occur, with branches in London (1967) and New York (1975). Like Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS was a typical representative of Swiss universal banking: at home, corporate and retail clients and asset management; mainly commercial banking for corporate clients abroad. In 1962, UBS’s assets totalled CHF 7.0 billion, and the bank led the field among Swiss banks for the first time. Further important milestones were the acquisition of Interhandel (1966) and of Phillips & Drew (1896) in 1985, the latter a British brokerage rich in tradition.
