Wasserstein, a fabric executive, and Lola Schleifer. He graduated from the University of Michigan at the age of 19, moving on to Harvard Law School and the Harvard Business School, where he worked as one of Ralph Nader’s “Nader’s Raiders.” 

Mr. Wasserstein, who began his career as a lawyer but quickly moved into the more lucrative field of investment banking, worked on some of the biggest deals of the last three decades, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’s takeover of RJR Nabisco, immortalized in the book and movie “Barbarians at the Gate.” 

He also became a member of New York’s social firmament, buying New York magazine, a prominent publication that chronicles the city and its major players. Mr. Wasserstein rarely looked like a stereotypical investment banker, preferring a rumpled look, his shirt often untucked. But he transformed deal-making from a business built on relationships, as practiced by forebears like André Meyer and Felix G. Rohatyn of Lazard, into one more akin to war, built on complex tactics and armies of bankers and lawyers.

Mr. Wasserstein is survived by his wife, Angela Chao, an executive at her family’s shipping company and the sister of Elaine Chao, the former labor secretary, and seven children.

With family members having served in each of the military branches, Sandy understands what it means to serve one’s country and dedicate oneself to military service. That love of service and commitment to her country led Sandy to leave high school early and enroll in the United States Air Force at the age of 17.

During her time in the Air Force, Sandy was married to a fellow military member, which resulted with her leaving the military to start a family. 

Years later, after her daughter was born, Sandy was faced with the difficult choice of whether or not to leave an abusive marriage and live with her daughter as a single parent. Like so many others across the nation, Sandy was now faced with the question of how to raise a child on one income while trying to make a better life for her daughter. Instead of turning to the state for help, Sandy challenged herself to work two and three jobs, all while she went back to school to get her GED.

That high school degree opened up a door for Sandy that would be life changing – working during the day and attending the police academy at night. After graduating Sandy served for seventeen years as a deputy sheriff in the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, doing everything from road patrol, foot patrol, and pawnshop oversight to intelligence and undercover work. During her time at the Sheriff’s Office, Sandy found the time to go back to school at night and earn her degree in Criminal Justice Administration from Columbia College while putting her daughter through college at the University of Central Florida. 

It was while serving as a deputy sheriff that Sandy met Frank Seton, a fellow deputy on the force. The two were married, and lived happily until he died tragically on duty. It was that terrible loss that caused Sandy to become an advocate for victim’s rights in Tallahassee, testifying before the state legislature and advocating for victims and citizens rights.

That same call to service that drew Sandy to volunteering for military service and signing up to keep our streets safe as a deputy sheriff made her choose to run for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives. . Sandy completed her service in the Florida House in 2010 and joined the U.S. House of Representatives on January 5, 2011.

Born in Wyandotte, Michigan, Sandy is an alumna of Columbia College. Today, she and her husband, Judge John Adams live in Orlando. Together they have three children.

One of the most high-profile and experienced Attorneys General in the nation’s history, Mr. Ashcroft led the U.S. law enforcement community through the challenging and transformational period following the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001. His tenure was highlighted by forceful public advocacy of President Bush’s strong anti-terrorism strategy. His quiet government influence was rated highest inside the Bush Administration by The National Journal.

Raised in Springfield, Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft attended public schools until enrolling at Yale University, where he graduated with honors in 1964. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago in 1967. Prior to entering public service, Mr. Ashcroft taught business law at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He authored a book honoring his father, Lessons from a Father to His Son, and co-authored multiple editions of two college law textbooks with his wife, Janet. His career of public service began in 1973 as Missouri Auditor. He was later elected to two terms as the state’s Attorney General. His colleagues in the non-partisan National Association of Attorneys General elected him as their President.

As U.S. Attorney General, Mr. Ashcroft was the Chief Executive Officer of a Cabinet agency, larger than most Fortune 500 corporations, comprised of 112,000 employees with an annual operating budget of $22 billion. He ran the world’s largest international law firm, a national prison system and the world’s finest law enforcement agencies. Relying on his executive experience, he emphasized strategic management, integrating strategic planning, budgeting and performance measurement across the Department. For the first time in its history, the Justice Department earned a clean audit opinion, which it received each year of his tenure.

Mr. Ashcroft substantially reorganized the Justice Department to focus on its number one priority: to prevent another terrorist attack. Leveraging every legal tool available to law enforcement, including the critical tools provided in the USA PATRIOT Act, the Justice Department initiated a tough antiterrorism campaign that has assisted in disrupting over 150 terrorist plots worldwide, dismantling terrorist cells in cities across America, and convicting 191 individuals in terrorism-related investigations.",Person

His great success as a hedge fund manager allowed him to pursue his ambition of establishing open societies in place of authoritarian forms of government.

Soros set up his first non-U.S. foundation in Hungary in 1984. His signature move was to distribute photocopiers to universities, libraries, and civil society groups, breaking the communist party’s grip on information.

To help train a new generation of political and economic leaders, Soros founded the Central European University in 1991 as a center of research and policy analysis that promotes the principles of open, democratic societies. Support for education programs, from early childhood to university, accounted for as much as half of the Open Society Foundations’ annual program expenditures.

Beginning in 1993, the Foundations provided tens of millions of dollars for humanitarian aid and relief efforts during the wars in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, especially in besieged Sarajevo where construction crews braved sniper fire and artillery shells to connect residents to gas lines, electricity, and drinking water.

Born and raised in Greensboro, N.C., he is a graduate of the University North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1967) IHand Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business (1969). He holds eight honorary doctorates from universities and colleges throughout America.

Bowles began his business career at Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York as an associate in the corporate finance group. In that position, he saw the unfilled opportunity to provide corporate finance expertise to America’s middle-market companies. He soon returned home to North Carolina, where he founded and served as chairman and CEO of the Charlotte-based investment banking firm that became Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co. Bowles also was a founder of Kitty Hawk Capital, a venture capital company, and Carousel Capital, a middle-market private equity company.

In 1993, Bowles was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as director of the Small Business Administration, and later was tapped to serve as deputy White House chief of staff (1994-95) and White House chief of staff (1996-98). As chief of staff, he helped negotiate the first balanced budget in a generation. As a member of the National Economic Council and National Security Council, he helped guide domestic and foreign policy. In prior service as deputy White House chief of staff, Bowles helped direct the government’s response to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. After he left the White House, he also served from 1999 to 2001 as a general partner of Forstmann Little, a New York-based private equity firm. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2002 and 2004, and currently serves on the boards of Morgan Stanley and Cousins Properties.

Bowles has shown a life-long commitment to public service in North Carolina and beyond. He helped found Dogwood Equity, chaired the Rural Prosperity Task Force, and served as a trustee of the Golden LEAF Foundation—three entities designed to bring economic development to rural North Carolina. Bowles also has served as vice chair of Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte and as a trustee of the Duke Endowment. Family illness inspired Bowles to help lead efforts to create an ALS (Lou Gehrigs Disease) Center in Charlotte and to serve as the international president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In 2005, he was appointed United Nations deputy special envoy to 13 tsunami-affected countries in Southeast Asia.

Bowles has been married since 1971 to Crandall Close Bowles, retired chief executive officer of Springs Industries, one of the nation’s largest textile companies. They have three adult children: Sam, Annie, and Bill.

Tim Kaine grew up in Kansas City working in his father's ironworking shop. He attended the University of Missouri and Harvard Law School. Kaine's public service career began when he volunteered with missionaries in Honduras. Kaine practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, representing people denied housing opportunities because of their race or disability. Kaine taught legal ethics for six years at the University of Richmond Law School.

 Kaine was elected to four terms on the City Council, including two terms as Richmond's mayor. Kaine was elected Virginia's Lieutenant Governor in 2001. Kaine became the 70th Governor of Virginia on January 14, 2006 - the first Virginia Governor to be inaugurated at the Colonial Capitol in Williamsburg since Thomas Jefferson. 

Kaine is moving the state's focus from education competence to excellence. He put into law Virginia's first requirement for classroom teachers to receive regular and meaningful teacher evaluations. He is championing efforts to expand pre-kindergarten classes, bring teacher salaries up to the national average and raise the quality of the state's career and technical programs. 

Kaine worked to reform the financing and accountability of Virginia's transportation infrastructure including the first major increase in investment in more than two decades, a elevation of the importance of rail and public transit solutions, and innovative strategies to combine land use and transportation planning.

Kaine is focused on improving Virginians' access to the health care network. He is working with small businesses to expand their ability to purchase health insurance for their employees and is working to utilize the state's technology resources to improve the quality of health care and find cost savings for consumers.

Kaine has invested about $660 million in cleaning up Virginia's rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. In honor of Virginia's 400th anniversary, he embarked on an effort to preserve 400,000 acres of open space, farms and forests by the end of the decade, through the use of creative tax incentives and collaboration with environmental groups. He issued Virginia's first comprehensive energy plan and has appointed a Climate Change Commission to advise Virginia on reduction of greenhouse gases.

Kaine has worked to eliminate the estate tax, create Virginia's first sales tax holiday, take more than 140,000 low-income Virginians off the tax rolls, and give citizens more information to participate in local decisions about property tax rates. Virginia's unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the nation.",Person

His great success as a hedge fund manager allowed him to pursue his ambition of establishing open societies in place of authoritarian forms of government.

Soros set up his first non-U.S. foundation in Hungary in 1984. His signature move was to distribute photocopiers to universities, libraries, and civil society groups, breaking the communist party’s grip on information.

To help train a new generation of political and economic leaders, Soros founded the Central European University in 1991 as a center of research and policy analysis that promotes the principles of open, democratic societies. Support for education programs, from early childhood to university, accounted for as much as half of the Open Society Foundations’ annual program expenditures.

Beginning in 1993, the Foundations provided tens of millions of dollars for humanitarian aid and relief efforts during the wars in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, especially in besieged Sarajevo where construction crews braved sniper fire and artillery shells to connect residents to gas lines, electricity, and drinking water.

Together with his wife Chirlane, Bill is the proud parent of Chiara, a college sophomore, and Dante, a high school junior. Having raised their children in Brooklyn and sent them to New York City public schools, Bill and Chirlane understand firsthand the fundamental role parents and teachers share in educating the next generation - and of the importance of providing equal educational opportunities in all neighborhoods.

After graduating from NYU, Bill studied at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. He began his career in public service as a junior staffer for New York City's first African-American mayor, David N. Dinkins, and later became an assistant for community affairs at City Hall.

In 1997, Bill moved to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, working as Regional Director under then-Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, as New York and New Jersey's highest-ranking official in the department.

In 1999, Bill joined District 15's School Board in Brooklyn. In 2000, Hillary Clinton asked Bill to manage her historic campaign for the U.S. Senate. Two years later, Bill started his service on the New York City Council, representing the diverse Brooklyn neighborhoods of Park Slope, Sunset Park, Boro Park, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Windsor Terrace, Red Hook, and Kensington.

In his eight years on the City Council, Bill focused his efforts on improving public education, engaging parents, expanding affordable housing, and protecting New York's middle-class and working poor.

In 2010, Bill was sworn in as New York City Public Advocate, the second-highest citywide elected office. As Public Advocate, Bill launched the ""NYC Worst Landlords Watchlist"" to publicly identify landlords who took advantage of everyday New Yorkers, pressing them to improve building maintenance and upkeep.",Person

One of the most high-profile and experienced Attorneys General in the nation’s history, Mr. Ashcroft led the U.S. law enforcement community through the challenging and transformational period following the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001. His tenure was highlighted by forceful public advocacy of President Bush’s strong anti-terrorism strategy. His quiet government influence was rated highest inside the Bush Administration by The National Journal.

Raised in Springfield, Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft attended public schools until enrolling at Yale University, where he graduated with honors in 1964. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago in 1967. Prior to entering public service, Mr. Ashcroft taught business law at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He authored a book honoring his father, Lessons from a Father to His Son, and co-authored multiple editions of two college law textbooks with his wife, Janet. His career of public service began in 1973 as Missouri Auditor. He was later elected to two terms as the state’s Attorney General. His colleagues in the non-partisan National Association of Attorneys General elected him as their President.

As U.S. Attorney General, Mr. Ashcroft was the Chief Executive Officer of a Cabinet agency, larger than most Fortune 500 corporations, comprised of 112,000 employees with an annual operating budget of $22 billion. He ran the world’s largest international law firm, a national prison system and the world’s finest law enforcement agencies. Relying on his executive experience, he emphasized strategic management, integrating strategic planning, budgeting and performance measurement across the Department. For the first time in its history, the Justice Department earned a clean audit opinion, which it received each year of his tenure.

Mr. Ashcroft substantially reorganized the Justice Department to focus on its number one priority: to prevent another terrorist attack. Leveraging every legal tool available to law enforcement, including the critical tools provided in the USA PATRIOT Act, the Justice Department initiated a tough antiterrorism campaign that has assisted in disrupting over 150 terrorist plots worldwide, dismantling terrorist cells in cities across America, and convicting 191 individuals in terrorism-related investigations.",Person

Politics Runs In Family For Zakhem

How John Zakhem became the lawyer for the “all things Republican” in Colorado is no accident.  His recent role in the dust up about Secretary of State Gigi Dennis’ rule changes affecting unions and small donor committees represents the continuation of activism in the Zakhem family.

John’s father is Sam Zakhem, a man with a long history in the Republican Party.Sam Zakhem, an immigrant from Lebanon born in 1937, began his political career in 1974 when he was elected to the state House.  In 1977, he served as the chair of the Finance Committee.  He later served in the state Senate.

In 1996, Sam Zakhem was one of five Republicans who ran in the primary for the 6th Congressional District after the retirement of Republican Dan Schaefer.  The winner of that race was Tom Tancredo, with 25 percent of the vote.  Sam Zakhem pulled in 17 percent.

After his election defeat, Sam Zakhem was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to serve as Ambassador to Bahrain, a position he held until 1989.

In 1997, Sam Zakhem was nominated by beer baron Pete Coors to be chairman of the Colorado Republicans, a bid he eventually lost.  Not by a vote count, mind you.  The eventually winner, Steve Curtis, was declared by “acclamation” after a ballot-counting fiasco lasting hours ending with Zakhem conceding (some things never change).

Sam Zakhem also ran for the 7th Congressional District in 2002, the first year the district existed.  He ended up losing in a four-way primary.  Bob Beauprez was the winner with 38 percent of the vote.  Sam Zakhem received 19 percent.

As Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm steered through legislation modernizing banking, insurance and securities law, which had been languishing in Congress for 60 years. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allowed banks, securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as part of a financial services holding company.  Dodd-Frank did not change Gramm-Leach-Bliley but expanded it by requiring systemically significant non-banks to become financial services holding companies.

Phil Gramm holds a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia in economics, the subject he taught at Texas A&M University for 12 years. He has published numerous articles and books on subjects ranging from monetary theory and policy to private property and the economics of mineral extraction.

He is married to Dr. Wendy Lee Gramm, former Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Presidents Reagan and Bush. They have two sons, Marshall and Jeff and four grandchildren, Caroline, Will, Joshua and Gilbert.",Person

Congressman Allen West (FL-22) proudly and humbly serves the constituents of Florida's 22nd district, encompassing parts of beautiful Broward and Palm Beach Counties along South Florida's coastline.  Patriotism is in Congressman West's blood. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, in the same neighborhood where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr once preached, West is the third of four generations of military servicemen in his family. Before retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, West served as a Field Artillery Officer in several combat zones: in Operation Desert Storm, in Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he was battalion commander for the Army’s 4th Infantry Division, and in Afghanistan, where he trained Afghan officers to take on the responsibility of securing their own country.

In 2004, when it was time to retire from service, West  brought his wife and two young daughters to South Florida, where he taught high school for one year. He then returned to Afghanistan as an advisor to the Afghan army.
In November of 2010, Congressman West was honored to be able to continue his oath of service to his country when he was elected to be a Representative in the United States Congress.

""I have traded in my camouflage uniform for a suit,"" West said.  ""But the commitment to protect the people of the United States is still my mission.""

Congressman West received his Bachelors degree from University of Tennessee and Masters degree from Kansas State University, both in political science. He also holds a Master of Military Arts and Sciences from the US Army Command and General Staff Officer College in political theory and military operations.

In his Army career, Col. West has been honored many times, including a Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, three Army Commendation Medals (one with Valor), and a Valorous Unit Award. He received his valor award as a Captain in Desert Shield/Storm, was the US Army ROTC Instructor of the Year in 1993, and was a Distinguished Honor Graduate III Corps Assault School. He proudly wears the Army Master parachutist badge, Air Assault badge, Navy/Marine Corps parachutist insignia, Italian parachutist wings, and German proficiency badge (Bronze award).

Congressman West is an avid distance runner, a certified SCUBA diver, motorcyclist, and attends Community Christian Church in Tamarac, Florida.

--NEW YORK TIMES","Bachelor of Arts / Science",Education,"THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA",14957,"At the University of Pennsylvania, you'll find a historic, Ivy League school with highly selective admissions and a history of innovation in interdisciplinary education and scholarship. You'll also find a picturesque campus amidst a dynamic city and a world-class research institution.

Intellectual rigor and a practical outlook
Penn carries on the principles and spirit of its founder, Benjamin Franklin: entrepreneurship, innovation, invention, outreach, and a pragmatic love of knowledge. Franklin's practical outlook has remained a driving force in the university's development.

Top students
Today Penn is home to a diverse undergraduate student body of nearly 10,000, hailing from every state in the union and all around the globe. Admissions are among the most selective in the country and Penn consistently ranks among the top 10 universities in the annual U.S. News & World Report survey. Another 10,000 students are enrolled in Penn's 12 graduate and professional schools, which are national leaders in their fields. The Wharton School is consistently one of the nation's top three business schools. The School of Nursing is one of the two best in the U.S. The School of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Education, Law School, School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, and Annenberg School for Communication all rank among the top 10 schools in their fields.

A singular campus
With its green lawns and landmark architecture, our beautiful West Philadelphia campus houses all of Penn's activities, from student life, athletics, and academics to research, scholarship, and cultural life. All of Penn's 12 schools are located within walking distance of one another. This geographical unity, unique among Ivy League schools, supports and fosters Penn's interdisciplinary approach to education, scholarship, and research.

A vibrant city
Penn's picturesque campus is situated near the heart of Philadelphia, a vital and lively city. Our students and faculty enjoy both campus life and the expansive cultural offerings of the city. Penn makes a substantial investment in its surrounding neighborhood and offers ways for students and faculty to make community service part of their educational experience.

Crossing boundaries
True to our roots, Penn encourages both intellectual and practical pursuits. On our unified campus, this flexible mindset makes Penn a national leader in interdisciplinary programs, crossing traditional academic and professional boundaries to engage participants in the pursuit of new -- and useful -- knowledge. In addition to numerous cross-disciplinary majors and joint-degree programs, Penn is home to interdisciplinary institutions such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Management and Technology Program.

Powerful research
With 174 research centers and institutes, research is a substantial and esteemed enterprise at Penn. As of fiscal year 2006, the research community includes more than 4,200 faculty and 870 postdoctoral fellows, nearly 3,800 graduate students and 5,400 academic support staff and graduate assistants, and a research budget of $660 million. The scale and interdisciplinary character of our research activities make Penn a nationally-ranked research university.",Org

--NEW YORK TIMES","Campaign Contribution",Donation,"PHIL GRAMM",13826,"Senator Gramm is our Senior Partner at US Policy Metrics, overseeing our policy advisory team and acting as our Ambassador in Washington DC. Before US Policy Metrics, Senator Gramm was the Vice-Chairman of UBS Investment Bank for 9 years.  At UBS he focused on providing strategic economic, political and policy advice to major corporate and institutional clients all around the world. He provided senior leadership on such landmark IPOs as Visa, Bank of China, China Merchants Bank and LGPhillips in Korea.  He was instrumental in the follow-on equity offering for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the privatization of Telstra in Australia.

Senator Gramm served six years in the US House and eighteen years in the US Senate. His legislative record includes landmark bills like the Gramm-Latta Budget, which reduced federal spending, rebuilt national defense and mandated the Reagan tax cut and the Gramm-Rudman Act, which placed the first binding constraints on federal spending. As Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm steered through legislation modernizing banking, insurance and securities law, which had been languishing in Congress for 60 years. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allowed banks, securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as part of a financial services holding company.  Dodd-Frank did not change Gramm-Leach-Bliley but expanded it by requiring systemically significant non-banks to become financial services holding companies.

Phil Gramm holds a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia in economics, the subject he taught at Texas A&M University for 12 years. He has published numerous articles and books on subjects ranging from monetary theory and policy to private property and the economics of mineral extraction.

He is married to Dr. Wendy Lee Gramm, former Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Presidents Reagan and Bush. They have two sons, Marshall and Jeff and four grandchildren, Caroline, Will, Joshua and Gilbert.",Person

He holds eight honorary doctorates from universities and colleges throughout America.

Bowles began his business career at Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York as an associate in the corporate finance group. In that position, he saw the unfilled opportunity to provide corporate finance expertise to America’s middle-market companies. He soon returned home to North Carolina, where he founded and served as chairman and CEO of the Charlotte-based investment banking firm that became Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co. Bowles also was a founder of Kitty Hawk Capital, a venture capital company, and Carousel Capital, a middle-market private equity company.

In 1993, Bowles was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as director of the Small Business Administration, and later was tapped to serve as deputy White House chief of staff (1994-95) and White House chief of staff (1996-98). As chief of staff, he helped negotiate the first balanced budget in a generation. As a member of the National Economic Council and National Security Council, he helped guide domestic and foreign policy. In prior service as deputy White House chief of staff, Bowles helped direct the government’s response to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. After he left the White House, he also served from 1999 to 2001 as a general partner of Forstmann Little, a New York-based private equity firm. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2002 and 2004, and currently serves on the boards of Morgan Stanley and Cousins Properties.

Bowles has shown a life-long commitment to public service in North Carolina and beyond. He helped found Dogwood Equity, chaired the Rural Prosperity Task Force, and served as a trustee of the Golden LEAF Foundation—three entities designed to bring economic development to rural North Carolina. Bowles also has served as vice chair of Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte and as a trustee of the Duke Endowment. Family illness inspired Bowles to help lead efforts to create an ALS (Lou Gehrigs Disease) Center in Charlotte and to serve as the international president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In 2005, he was appointed United Nations deputy special envoy to 13 tsunami-affected countries in Southeast Asia.

As a child he was extremely close to his maternal grandfather, Milos, who passed away in 1990. The two would spend a couple of weeks every summer hunting and fishing in a town outside of Prague (Ivana is Czechoslovakian). The fast-talking Donald Jr. is fluent in Czech and named one of his sons Tristan Milos, after his grandfather. 

After boarding school (Pennsylvania's prestigious Hill School), he followed in his father's footsteps — as most of the Trump kids have — to The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in finance and real estate.

In 2001, a year after he graduated from college, Donald Jr. went to work for his dad for the second time. (The first time was when he was 13 and earning minimum wage plus tips as a dock attendant at Trump Castle.) Now an executive vice president at The Trump Organization, he cut his teeth with the development of Trump Place at West Side Yards and has gone on to spearhead projects in Chicago, Las Vegas, Scotland, and India. 

Thanks to a fix-up from his dad, he met his wife, Vanessa, at a fashion show. He caught a lot of heat for proposing to her in front of a jewelry store with a bunch of photographers standing by. The rumor-mill called it a publicity stunt and claimed he'd gotten the $100,000 ring on trade. But as the happy couple has welcomed five children in the past seven years, that news story has long since been buried.",Person

Congressman Allen West (FL-22) proudly and humbly serves the constituents of Florida's 22nd district, encompassing parts of beautiful Broward and Palm Beach Counties along South Florida's coastline.  Patriotism is in Congressman West's blood. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, in the same neighborhood where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr once preached, West is the third of four generations of military servicemen in his family. Before retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, West served as a Field Artillery Officer in several combat zones: in Operation Desert Storm, in Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he was battalion commander for the Army’s 4th Infantry Division, and in Afghanistan, where he trained Afghan officers to take on the responsibility of securing their own country.

In 2004, when it was time to retire from service, West  brought his wife and two young daughters to South Florida, where he taught high school for one year. He then returned to Afghanistan as an advisor to the Afghan army.
In November of 2010, Congressman West was honored to be able to continue his oath of service to his country when he was elected to be a Representative in the United States Congress.

""I have traded in my camouflage uniform for a suit,"" West said.  ""But the commitment to protect the people of the United States is still my mission.""

Congressman West received his Bachelors degree from University of Tennessee and Masters degree from Kansas State University, both in political science. He also holds a Master of Military Arts and Sciences from the US Army Command and General Staff Officer College in political theory and military operations.

In his Army career, Col. West has been honored many times, including a Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, three Army Commendation Medals (one with Valor), and a Valorous Unit Award. He received his valor award as a Captain in Desert Shield/Storm, was the US Army ROTC Instructor of the Year in 1993, and was a Distinguished Honor Graduate III Corps Assault School. He proudly wears the Army Master parachutist badge, Air Assault badge, Navy/Marine Corps parachutist insignia, Italian parachutist wings, and German proficiency badge (Bronze award).

As Chair, Emanuel led the Democratic Caucus in fulfilling its campaign promise to pass legislation reflecting the values and priorities of the American people.

Under Billy Tauzin’s leadership, PhRMA today is a national leader in advocating on behalf of patients and their access to medicines, the need for national healthcare reform and on behalf of creating and sustaining an economic environment in the United States that rewards medical innovation. Recent PhRMA initiatives include: Establishing voluntary Guiding Principles on Direct to Consumer Advertising for pharmaceutical research and biotechnology companies; creation of a PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals; and, launching Global Health Progress Initiative to Expand Efforts to Improve Health in Developing Countries. 

In addition, under Billy Tauzin, PhRMA and its member companies created the Partnership for Prescription Assistance (PPA): a nation-wide network of more than 1300 state, local and national partners helping to connect uninsured or financially struggling patients to more than 475 patient assistance programs providing free or nearly free prescription medicines – more than 200 programs sponsored directly by PhRMA member companies. To date, PPA has helped connect more than 5.7 million uninsured and financially struggling patients in all 50 states to participating PPA programs.

As a cancer survivor, Billy Tauzin understands firsthand what patients face as they search for hope, treatment and cures. This unique insight guides his leadership as PhRMA president where he is helping to develop solutions to America’s health care challenges so patients now and in the future have the medicines they need.

Throughout a long and distinguished public service career, including 13 terms representing the people of the 3rd Congressional District of Louisiana, Billy Tauzin exhibited creativity and a leadership style that made him a standout among our nation’s elected officials. As a Member of Congress, he was called “knowledgeable and eloquent” by the Almanac of American Politics and “one of the House's savviest members” by National Journal Magazine.

Billy Tauzin began his public service career in the Louisiana State Legislature where he served in a variety of distinguished posts such as Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and Chief Administration Floor Leader. He was chosen twice as one of Louisiana's ""Ten Best Legislators.""

He was first elected to the U.S. House in 1980 as a Democrat. Because his conservative views increasingly led him to vote with GOP House members despite his Democratic affiliation, he switched parties in 1995. In 1998, he joined with House Majority Leader Dick Armey to propose a revamping of the tax code.

While in Congress, he held several leadership positions, beginning with his chairmanship of a Merchant Marine Subcommittee, which oversaw legislation related to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. In September 1995 he was named Deputy Majority Whip; he is the first American to have been part of the leadership of both parties in the House. In an effort to promote a spirit of bipartisan cooperation on Capitol Hill, he co-founded and served as Co-Chairman of the Mainstream Conservative Alliance, better known as Republican ""Blue Dogs.""

Until February, 2004, he served as the Chairman of the influential House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over all interstate and foreign commerce, including energy, telecommunications, health care, biomedical research, consumer protection, the environment and travel and tourism. During his tenure, he left his mark on issues ranging from natural gas, airline, trucking and electricity deregulation to the Clean Air Act, Superfund and the historic Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996. In addition, he was the original author of the Securities Litigation Reform Act and the Cable Act – the only bills over the past decade to become law despite a Presidential veto. As chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, he helped President George W. Bush win passage of a Medicare prescription drug bill.

Suffering health problems that led him to re-evaluate his life, Tauzin announced in February 2004 that he would not run for another term. Over the years, Tauzin has been honored by such diverse groups as the Chamber of Commerce, Farm Bureau, National Federal of Independent Business, B'nai B'rith, Concord Coalition, Business Software Alliance, National Association of Manufacturers, Christian Coalition, Boy Scouts of America, National Association of Broadcasters, the 3rd Congressional District Black Caucus, and many more.

Mr. Forrester did not flourish, however, until he entered the business world. In 1990, he founded Benecard Services, a company that manages pharmacy benefits. While Mr. Forrester will not reveal its precise value, a financial disclosure form filed in 2002 indicated that his 51 percent stake in the company was worth more than $50 million dollars.

That wealth helped Mr. Forrester win over wary Republicans in 2002, when he reentered New Jersey politics as suddenly as an unexpected guest. He spent $3 million to win the primary for United States Senate and was poised to pull off the unlikely feat of defeating the incumbent, Robert G. Torricelli, who was troubled by ethics questions. But six weeks before Election Day, Democrats replaced Mr. Torricelli with retired Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, and when the State Supreme Court allowed the candidate swap to stand - even though it took place after the deadline for placing candidates on the ballot - he went on to defeat Mr. Forrester.",Person

Between 1972 and 1977, he served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft. Perry graduated from Texas A&M University in1972, where he was a member of the corps of cadets, a junior and senior yell leader, and an animal science major. From 1985 to 1991, he served in the Texas House of Representatives. Perry was elected commissioner of agriculture in 1990, and served two terms. As lieutenant governor, Perry worked with legislators to pass a balanced budget that included record tax cuts, teacher pay raises, and a historic school funding increase.

Perry was sworn in as the 47th governor of Texas on December 21, 2000, and was elected to a four-year term in November 2002. Perry has focused on   initiatives to improve education and the job climate, keep taxes low, and ensure disciplined state spending.  In 2003, he joined legislators of both parties in passing a balanced budget without a tax hike despite a $10 billion shortfall. This budget increased education and healthcare spending despite tough economic times, and invested in jobs with the new $295 million Texas Enterprise Fund. Perry also signed the nation's most sweeping lawsuit reforms to address skyrocketing malpractice insurance rates. Since the law's signing, hospitals and doctors have experienced insurance savings, and obstetricians and specialists are returning to practice in previously high-risk areas.

Through Perry's efforts, the number of children with health insurance under Medicaid and CHIP has more than doubled since 1999, and has increased by more than 100,000 since January 2003. He signed legislation allowing small businesses to pool together to offer affordable health insurance policies, and also reduced the number of mandates for private sector policies.  Perry's transportation plan, the Trans Texas Corridor, provides thousands of miles of new roads, new rail lines, and room for petroleum and electric lines, water lines and broadband technology. This proposal, along with new renewable energy requirements and emissions reduction legislation, will help clean the air in urban areas.  Perry's vision for school finance reform focuses on results-based incentives; cutting, capping and controlling property taxes; providing greater equity; and protecting the job climate. Perry is a lifetime member of American Legion Post #75 and  the Perrys are members of Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin.

In 2003, he joined legislators of both parties in passing a balanced budget without a tax hike despite a $10 billion shortfall. This budget increased education and healthcare spending despite tough economic times, and invested in jobs with the new $295 million Texas Enterprise Fund. Perry also signed the nation's most sweeping lawsuit reforms to address skyrocketing malpractice insurance rates. Since the law's signing, hospitals and doctors have experienced insurance savings, and obstetricians and specialists are returning to practice in previously high-risk areas.

Through Perry's efforts, the number of children with health insurance under Medicaid and CHIP has more than doubled since 1999, and has increased by more than 100,000 since January 2003. He signed legislation allowing small businesses to pool together to offer affordable health insurance policies, and also reduced the number of mandates for private sector policies.  Perry's transportation plan, the Trans Texas Corridor, provides thousands of miles of new roads, new rail lines, and room for petroleum and electric lines, water lines and broadband technology. This proposal, along with new renewable energy requirements and emissions reduction legislation, will help clean the air in urban areas.  Perry's vision for school finance reform focuses on results-based incentives; cutting, capping and controlling property taxes; providing greater equity; and protecting the job climate.

One of the most high-profile and experienced Attorneys General in the nation’s history, Mr. Ashcroft led the U.S. law enforcement community through the challenging and transformational period following the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001. His tenure was highlighted by forceful public advocacy of President Bush’s strong anti-terrorism strategy. His quiet government influence was rated highest inside the Bush Administration by The National Journal.

Raised in Springfield, Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft attended public schools until enrolling at Yale University, where he graduated with honors in 1964. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago in 1967. Prior to entering public service, Mr. Ashcroft taught business law at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He authored a book honoring his father, Lessons from a Father to His Son, and co-authored multiple editions of two college law textbooks with his wife, Janet. His career of public service began in 1973 as Missouri Auditor. He was later elected to two terms as the state’s Attorney General. His colleagues in the non-partisan National Association of Attorneys General elected him as their President.

As U.S. Attorney General, Mr. Ashcroft was the Chief Executive Officer of a Cabinet agency, larger than most Fortune 500 corporations, comprised of 112,000 employees with an annual operating budget of $22 billion. He ran the world’s largest international law firm, a national prison system and the world’s finest law enforcement agencies. Relying on his executive experience, he emphasized strategic management, integrating strategic planning, budgeting and performance measurement across the Department. For the first time in its history, the Justice Department earned a clean audit opinion, which it received each year of his tenure.

Mr. Ashcroft substantially reorganized the Justice Department to focus on its number one priority: to prevent another terrorist attack. Leveraging every legal tool available to law enforcement, including the critical tools provided in the USA PATRIOT Act, the Justice Department initiated a tough antiterrorism campaign that has assisted in disrupting over 150 terrorist plots worldwide, dismantling terrorist cells in cities across America, and convicting 191 individuals in terrorism-related investigations.",Person

In 1995, he was chosen by his peers to serve as senate majority leader, a post he held for six years. 

 Rounds was sworn-in as South Dakota’s 31st governor on January 7, 2003, and re-elected in 2006. Since taking office, Rounds has been committed to growing South Dakota’s economy, improving the daily lives of South Dakota citizens and providing opportunities for young people to stay in South Dakota. Working together with the legislature and citizens of South Dakota, he balanced the state budget, reduced the structural deficit and created a sales tax relief program on food for individuals within 150 percent of the poverty level. 

 Rounds reorganized the Department of Education to better embrace the concepts of ""No Child Left Behind."" During his tenure, funding in the state aid to education formula grew from $3,889 to $4,496 per student. As part of Rounds’ vision for education in South Dakota, the 2010 Education (2010E) Initiative was created. This plan was developed to guide South Dakota’s public education system into the next decade by establishing measurable goals, identifying objectives and outlining specific action steps. In addition, 2,400 new scholarships were created to encourage college students to stay in South Dakota and he secured over $27 million in external funding by opening six university research centers to provide our students graduate work and jobs created by the research. 

 Under Rounds’ leadership, a law was passed to regulate pharmacy benefits management companies; important clean water projects were funded; recreational opportunities were expanded; the Missouri River Summit was initiated to discuss the management of the Missouri River; and the 2010 Economic Development Initiative was designed to set goals for economic growth and visitor spending in South Dakota.",Person

After arriving in Florida, he helped start a real estate development company that today is one of the largest, full-service commercial real estate companies in South Florida. In 1987-1988, he served as Florida's secretary of commerce and promoted Florida's business climate worldwide. Following an unsuccessful bid in 1994 for the governor's office, Bush founded the Foundation for Florida's Future, a not-for-profit organization to influence public policy at the grassroots level. As chairman of the foundation, he cofounded the state's first charter school - Liberty City Charter School - with the Urban League of Greater Miami.

He was elected Florida's forty-third governor in 1998 and reelected in 2002, becoming the first Republican to be reelected governor in the state's history. While in office, his top priority was to create a world-class educational system through high standards and increased accountability. To achieve this goal, he provided a record four-year increase of $2.9 billion (26 percent) in K-12 funding. He believed passionately that all children should learn a year's worth of knowledge in a year's worth of time. Bush also boosted the state's reserve funds while reducing the state's tax burden to its lowest level in a decade. He focused the state's resources toward protecting the state's natural environment with an historic $2-billion commitment to saving Florida's Everglades. He has increased health insurance coverage for needy children and provided unprecedented levels of funding and services to the elderly and the developmentally disabled.

Mr. Bush served as Governor of the State of Florida from January 1999 until January 2007.

Prior to his election as Governor, Mr. Bush worked as a real estate executive and pursued other entrepreneurial ventures in Florida from 1981 to 1998, and served as Secretary of Commerce for the State of Florida from 1987 to 1988.

Prior to 1981, Mr. Bush served in various positions at Texas Commerce Bank in Houston, Texas and in Caracas, Venezuela. Mr. Bush also served as Chairman of the Dade County, Florida Republican Party. He also formed and serves as chairman of The Foundation For Florida’s Future, a not-for-profit public policy organization, and the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a not-for-profit charitable organization.

Tim Kaine grew up in Kansas City working in his father's ironworking shop. He attended the University of Missouri and Harvard Law School. Kaine's public service career began when he volunteered with missionaries in Honduras. Kaine practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, representing people denied housing opportunities because of their race or disability. Kaine taught legal ethics for six years at the University of Richmond Law School.

 Kaine was elected to four terms on the City Council, including two terms as Richmond's mayor. Kaine was elected Virginia's Lieutenant Governor in 2001. Kaine became the 70th Governor of Virginia on January 14, 2006 - the first Virginia Governor to be inaugurated at the Colonial Capitol in Williamsburg since Thomas Jefferson. 

Kaine is moving the state's focus from education competence to excellence. He put into law Virginia's first requirement for classroom teachers to receive regular and meaningful teacher evaluations. He is championing efforts to expand pre-kindergarten classes, bring teacher salaries up to the national average and raise the quality of the state's career and technical programs. 

Kaine worked to reform the financing and accountability of Virginia's transportation infrastructure including the first major increase in investment in more than two decades, a elevation of the importance of rail and public transit solutions, and innovative strategies to combine land use and transportation planning.

Kaine is focused on improving Virginians' access to the health care network. He is working with small businesses to expand their ability to purchase health insurance for their employees and is working to utilize the state's technology resources to improve the quality of health care and find cost savings for consumers.

Kaine has invested about $660 million in cleaning up Virginia's rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. In honor of Virginia's 400th anniversary, he embarked on an effort to preserve 400,000 acres of open space, farms and forests by the end of the decade, through the use of creative tax incentives and collaboration with environmental groups. He issued Virginia's first comprehensive energy plan and has appointed a Climate Change Commission to advise Virginia on reduction of greenhouse gases.

Kaine has worked to eliminate the estate tax, create Virginia's first sales tax holiday, take more than 140,000 low-income Virginians off the tax rolls, and give citizens more information to participate in local decisions about property tax rates. Virginia's unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the nation.",Person

Booker, 40, is the Mayor of Newark, New Jersey. He took the oath of office as Mayor of New Jersey’s largest city on July 1, 2006 following a sweeping electoral victory.

Elected with a clear mandate for change, Mayor Booker has begun work on realizing a bold vision for the city. Newark’s mission is to set a national standard for urban transformation by marshalling its resources to achieve security, economic abundance and an environment that is nurturing and empowering for individuals and families.

Mid-way through his first term as Mayor, Mayor Booker and his Administration have made meaningful strides towards achieving the City’s mission.  As of July 1, 2008, Newark, New Jersey led the nation among large cities for reductions in shootings and murders, achieving decreases of more than 40% reductions in both categories. Radical transformation of the Newark Police Department under Mayor Booker’s leadership, together with the deployment of over 100 surveillance cameras throughout City, has led to Newark setting the nationwide pace for crime reduction.

Among other recent notable achievements in the past two years, under Mayor Booker’s leadership, the City of Newark has committed to a $40 million transformation of the City’s parks and playgrounds through a ground-breaking public/private partnership.  The Booker Administration has also doubled affordable housing production within the last two years.  

Mayor Booker’s political career began in 1998, after serving as Staff Attorney for the Urban Justice Center in Newark. He rose to prominence as Newark’s Central Ward Councilman. During his four years of service from 1998-2002, then-Councilman Booker earned a reputation as a leader with innovative ideas and bold actions, from increasing security in public housing to building new playgrounds. This work was the foundation for his leadership as Mayor.  For this work, he has been recognized in numerous publications, including, among others, Time, Esquire, New Jersey Monthly (naming him as one of New Jersey’s top 40 under 40), Black Enterprise (naming him to the Hot List, America’s Most Powerful Players under 40) and The New York Times Magazine.

Reflecting his commitment to education, Mayor Booker is a member of numerous boards and advisory committees including Democrats for Education Reform, Columbia University Teachers’ College Board of Trustees and the Black Alliance for Educational Options. Mayor Booker received his B. A. and M. A. from Stanford University, a B. A. in Modern History at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, and completed his law degree at Yale Universi",Person

The second of four children, he was raised by a single mother in Saranac Lake in the heart of the Adirondack Park.  At an early age Doug started working to help his mother pay the bills. By the time he was fourteen he was pumping gas at a local service station and in his free time he’d help out the mechanics. Before he turned sixteen he had totally rebuilt a 1955 Chevrolet which was to be was to become his first car and the first example of the grit, determination, and “can do” attitude that has led Doug through life.

Though he graduated near the top of his class at Saranac Regional High, his future looked bleak. He simply could not afford the cost of a college education, but local business and civic leaders believed in him and soon raised the scholarship money he needed. Over the course of his undergraduate career Doug attended North Country Community College, SUNY Canton and graduated in 1973 from SUNY Plattsburgh with a Bachelor’s Degree in Accounting.

While attending college Doug had enlisted in the Army serving as a member of the New York State National Guard from 1970 – 1973 and the U.S. Army Reserves from 1973 -1976 He held the rank of Staff Sergeant at the time of his discharge. 

""Upon graduation from Plattsburgh, Doug set off with his new wife, Carol, for Hartford, Connecticut, having accepted a position with Price-Waterhouse & Company. The ensuing years were busy ones, with Doug effectively balancing a demanding career with his obligation to the U.S. Army Reserves.  During these years Carol gave birth to their first two children, (Ashleah and Douglas), while Doug continued his education as a part-time student, earning an MBA in Finance and Accounting from the University of Connecticut (1976) and his certification as a CPA (1977).""

In 1977 Doug and his family returned to the North Country for a new job as Assistant Controller for the Lake Placid 1980 Olympic Organizing Committee. On his first day on the job his boss quit and at 27 years old Doug assumed the position of Corporate Controller, overseeing a budget of $150 million and eventually 2,500 employees and 6000 volunteers. After the completion of the Olympics, Doug managed to negotiate the purchase of a local accounting firm and thus launch his career as CPA, entrepreneur and civic leader. 

Today, 29 years later, Doug is a Managing Partner of Dragon Benware Crowley & Co.
( www.dragonbenware.com ) with five offices across the North Country  and oversees Hoffman Family Enterprise ( www.hoffmanfamilyenterprises.com ) a diverse group of companies involved in Investments, Real Estate, Construction, Hospitality and Tourism in and around the Lake Placid/Saranac Lake area.

Over the years Doug has played an active leadership role in his community donating time, energy, and wisdom to such organizations as the: Adirondack Medical Center, Adirondack Medical Center Foundation, Olympic Regional Development Authority, North Country Community College, Adirondack Economic Development Corporation, Lake Placid/Essex County Visitors Bureau, Lake Placid Fire Department, North Elba/Essex County Republican Committee, Lake Placid Lions Club and the Adirondack Community Methodist Church.",Person

Congressman Allen West (FL-22) proudly and humbly serves the constituents of Florida's 22nd district, encompassing parts of beautiful Broward and Palm Beach Counties along South Florida's coastline.  Patriotism is in Congressman West's blood. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, in the same neighborhood where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr once preached, West is the third of four generations of military servicemen in his family. Before retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, West served as a Field Artillery Officer in several combat zones: in Operation Desert Storm, in Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he was battalion commander for the Army’s 4th Infantry Division, and in Afghanistan, where he trained Afghan officers to take on the responsibility of securing their own country.

In 2004, when it was time to retire from service, West  brought his wife and two young daughters to South Florida, where he taught high school for one year. He then returned to Afghanistan as an advisor to the Afghan army.
In November of 2010, Congressman West was honored to be able to continue his oath of service to his country when he was elected to be a Representative in the United States Congress.

""I have traded in my camouflage uniform for a suit,"" West said.  ""But the commitment to protect the people of the United States is still my mission.""

Congressman West received his Bachelors degree from University of Tennessee and Masters degree from Kansas State University, both in political science. He also holds a Master of Military Arts and Sciences from the US Army Command and General Staff Officer College in political theory and military operations.

In his Army career, Col. West has been honored many times, including a Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, three Army Commendation Medals (one with Valor), and a Valorous Unit Award. He received his valor award as a Captain in Desert Shield/Storm, was the US Army ROTC Instructor of the Year in 1993, and was a Distinguished Honor Graduate III Corps Assault School. He proudly wears the Army Master parachutist badge, Air Assault badge, Navy/Marine Corps parachutist insignia, Italian parachutist wings, and German proficiency badge (Bronze award).

He also represents various non-profit organizations before state government. In addition, he provides advice and counsel on legal and regulatory matters to charter school organizations.
He began his professional career working for Representative John W. Wydler  on the professional staff of the Committee on Government Operations,  U.S. House of Representatives.  From 1983-86, he was Commissioner of the New York State Legislative Bill Drafting,  appointed by then state Senate Majority Leader Warren Anderson. The Commission is charged with the drafting and technical review of all bills and resolutions introduced into the state legislature.
Mr. Faso was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1986 and served as Minority Leader between 1998 and 2002. In the Assembly, he gained a reputation as a proponent of fiscal responsibility, lower taxes and budget reform.  Mr. Faso was also an early proponent of the establishment of charter schools and was the sponsor of the first legislative proposal to create a charter school law in New York State.  As Minority Leader, he was also instrumental in the passage of charter school legislation in 1998.
In 1994, Mr. Faso was asked by Governor-elect George E. Pataki to chair his budget transition team. In that capacity Faso supervised the staff of the state division of the budget in formulating the initial budget proposal on behalf of the newly elected Governor, closing a $5 billion deficit.  The budget that Faso prepared was the first New York State budget in 52 years to actually reduce spending on a year to year basis.  Mr. Faso became Ranking Minority Member of the Assembly Committee on Ways and Means and in 1998, was elected Minority Leader of the state Assembly. Mr. Faso stepped down as Minority Leader in  March, 2002 when he announced his candidacy for state Comptroller, an election he lost by a narrow margin.

With the 2002 Winter Olympics mired in controversy and facing serious financial crisis, Romney was asked to become President and CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. During the three years he ran the games, Romney succeeded in erasing a $379 million operating deficit, organizing 23,000 volunteers, galvanizing community spirit, overseeing an unprecedented security mobilization to ensure public safety, and leading one of the most successful Olympics in the nation's history.

He was elected governor of Massachusetts in November 2002. Romney was recently appointed by President George W.

Before US Policy Metrics, Senator Gramm was the Vice-Chairman of UBS Investment Bank for 9 years.  At UBS he focused on providing strategic economic, political and policy advice to major corporate and institutional clients all around the world. He provided senior leadership on such landmark IPOs as Visa, Bank of China, China Merchants Bank and LGPhillips in Korea.  He was instrumental in the follow-on equity offering for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the privatization of Telstra in Australia.

Senator Gramm served six years in the US House and eighteen years in the US Senate. His legislative record includes landmark bills like the Gramm-Latta Budget, which reduced federal spending, rebuilt national defense and mandated the Reagan tax cut and the Gramm-Rudman Act, which placed the first binding constraints on federal spending. As Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm steered through legislation modernizing banking, insurance and securities law, which had been languishing in Congress for 60 years.

Between 1972 and 1977, he served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft. Perry graduated from Texas A&M University in1972, where he was a member of the corps of cadets, a junior and senior yell leader, and an animal science major. From 1985 to 1991, he served in the Texas House of Representatives. Perry was elected commissioner of agriculture in 1990, and served two terms. As lieutenant governor, Perry worked with legislators to pass a balanced budget that included record tax cuts, teacher pay raises, and a historic school funding increase.

Perry was sworn in as the 47th governor of Texas on December 21, 2000, and was elected to a four-year term in November 2002. Perry has focused on   initiatives to improve education and the job climate, keep taxes low, and ensure disciplined state spending.  In 2003, he joined legislators of both parties in passing a balanced budget without a tax hike despite a $10 billion shortfall. This budget increased education and healthcare spending despite tough economic times, and invested in jobs with the new $295 million Texas Enterprise Fund. Perry also signed the nation's most sweeping lawsuit reforms to address skyrocketing malpractice insurance rates. Since the law's signing, hospitals and doctors have experienced insurance savings, and obstetricians and specialists are returning to practice in previously high-risk areas.

Through Perry's efforts, the number of children with health insurance under Medicaid and CHIP has more than doubled since 1999, and has increased by more than 100,000 since January 2003. He signed legislation allowing small businesses to pool together to offer affordable health insurance policies, and also reduced the number of mandates for private sector policies.  Perry's transportation plan, the Trans Texas Corridor, provides thousands of miles of new roads, new rail lines, and room for petroleum and electric lines, water lines and broadband technology. This proposal, along with new renewable energy requirements and emissions reduction legislation, will help clean the air in urban areas.  Perry's vision for school finance reform focuses on results-based incentives; cutting, capping and controlling property taxes; providing greater equity; and protecting the job climate. Perry is a lifetime member of American Legion Post #75 and  the Perrys are members of Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin. Perry and his wife Anita have two children.",Person

When his campaign commenced, he left his position as the White House Chief of Staff. Prior to joining President Barack H. Obama's administration, Emanuel served in the House of Representatives, representing the fifth district of Illinois, and was Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. As an advocate for Chicago's working families, Emanuel served on the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxes, trade, Social Security, and Medicare issues.

Appointed by then House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Emanuel served as Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the 2006 cycle. Under his leadership, Democrats gained 30 seats in the House without losing a single incumbent, and ushered in a new Democratic majority for the first time in more than a decade.

In January 2007, the new majority elected Emanuel to serve as Democratic Caucus Chair, the fourth-highest-ranking member of the House Democratic Leadership. As Chair, Emanuel led the Democratic Caucus in fulfilling its campaign promise to pass legislation reflecting the values and priorities of the American people.

Before being elected to Congress, Emanuel worked at the Chicago investment bank Wasserstein Perella. He was a core member of the Clinton White House from 1993 to 1998, starting as the national finance director for the 1992 campaign and eventually becoming Senior Adviser to the President for Policy and Strategy. In 1989, Emanuel was a senior adviser and chief fundraiser for Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's campaign. He also played an important role in Paul Simon's 1984 campaign for the Senate.

Emanuel graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1981 and received a Master's Degree in Speech and Communication from Northwestern University in 1985. He and his wife, Amy Rule, have three children, Zach, Ilana, and Leah.",Person

Congressman Allen West (FL-22) proudly and humbly serves the constituents of Florida's 22nd district, encompassing parts of beautiful Broward and Palm Beach Counties along South Florida's coastline.  Patriotism is in Congressman West's blood. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, in the same neighborhood where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr once preached, West is the third of four generations of military servicemen in his family. Before retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, West served as a Field Artillery Officer in several combat zones: in Operation Desert Storm, in Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he was battalion commander for the Army’s 4th Infantry Division, and in Afghanistan, where he trained Afghan officers to take on the responsibility of securing their own country.

In 2004, when it was time to retire from service, West  brought his wife and two young daughters to South Florida, where he taught high school for one year. He then returned to Afghanistan as an advisor to the Afghan army.
In November of 2010, Congressman West was honored to be able to continue his oath of service to his country when he was elected to be a Representative in the United States Congress.

""I have traded in my camouflage uniform for a suit,"" West said.  ""But the commitment to protect the people of the United States is still my mission.""

Congressman West received his Bachelors degree from University of Tennessee and Masters degree from Kansas State University, both in political science. He also holds a Master of Military Arts and Sciences from the US Army Command and General Staff Officer College in political theory and military operations.

In his Army career, Col. West has been honored many times, including a Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, three Army Commendation Medals (one with Valor), and a Valorous Unit Award. He received his valor award as a Captain in Desert Shield/Storm, was the US Army ROTC Instructor of the Year in 1993, and was a Distinguished Honor Graduate III Corps Assault School. He proudly wears the Army Master parachutist badge, Air Assault badge, Navy/Marine Corps parachutist insignia, Italian parachutist wings, and German proficiency badge (Bronze award).

We fulfill our mission mainly by providing challenging, hands-on civic education programs for students and teachers in Washington, D.C. These programs are known for their positive impact on student attitudes and for giving teachers valuable insights to take back to classrooms nationwide. Using the nation’s capital as a living classroom, participants get a “close up” view of government and democracy in action. They return to their communities confident to play meaningful roles. Our grads also  qualify to earn credit at leading schools such as University of Virginia and Indiana University. 

Our diverse services include programs for middle schools and high schools, as well as programs for constituencies such as Native Americans, New Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Summer programs include a College Prep series and a July 4th program that connects the founding documents to today's citizens. During the academic year, teachers typically travel with their students and participate on our unique teacher program, sharing “best practices” with peers. During the summer, students typically come on their own or in small groups to participate on accelerated and theme-based programs. 

Over the past four decades, Close Up has developed a teaching method that appeals to virtually all types of students and that is delivered by our well-trained faculty. We believe this is a major reason why 94% of alums say that Close Up helped them better understand their roles as citizens. Our 650,000 alums come from all walks of life as well as every state, every territory, and several countries. Many of our teachers and students fundraise to attend; others attend thanks to the generosity of private and public funders such as the U.S. Congress, which has provided need-based fellowships every year since our inception.

We also fulfill our mission through classroom teaching tools. The most notable is “Current Issues.” This annual textbook, now in its 33rd edition, is relied on by teachers nationwide to stimulate student debate on key policy issues. We also have produced hundreds of TV shows that appeared on C-SPAN for over 30 years and that feature Close Up students dialoguing with U.S. presidents, lawmakers, and the media.

Democracy is government for the people by the people. At Close Up, we complement what teachers do in classrooms nationwide so that our young people will play informed and active roles in making the world a better place to live.",Org

He took the oath of office as Mayor of New Jersey’s largest city on July 1, 2006 following a sweeping electoral victory.

Elected with a clear mandate for change, Mayor Booker has begun work on realizing a bold vision for the city. Newark’s mission is to set a national standard for urban transformation by marshalling its resources to achieve security, economic abundance and an environment that is nurturing and empowering for individuals and families.

Mid-way through his first term as Mayor, Mayor Booker and his Administration have made meaningful strides towards achieving the City’s mission.  As of July 1, 2008, Newark, New Jersey led the nation among large cities for reductions in shootings and murders, achieving decreases of more than 40% reductions in both categories. Radical transformation of the Newark Police Department under Mayor Booker’s leadership, together with the deployment of over 100 surveillance cameras throughout City, has led to Newark setting the nationwide pace for crime reduction.

Among other recent notable achievements in the past two years, under Mayor Booker’s leadership, the City of Newark has committed to a $40 million transformation of the City’s parks and playgrounds through a ground-breaking public/private partnership.  The Booker Administration has also doubled affordable housing production within the last two years.  

Mayor Booker’s political career began in 1998, after serving as Staff Attorney for the Urban Justice Center in Newark. He rose to prominence as Newark’s Central Ward Councilman. During his four years of service from 1998-2002, then-Councilman Booker earned a reputation as a leader with innovative ideas and bold actions, from increasing security in public housing to building new playgrounds. This work was the foundation for his leadership as Mayor.  For this work, he has been recognized in numerous publications, including, among others, Time, Esquire, New Jersey Monthly (naming him as one of New Jersey’s top 40 under 40), Black Enterprise (naming him to the Hot List, America’s Most Powerful Players under 40) and The New York Times Magazine.

Reflecting his commitment to education, Mayor Booker is a member of numerous boards and advisory committees including Democrats for Education Reform, Columbia University Teachers’ College Board of Trustees and the Black Alliance for Educational Options. Mayor Booker received his B. A. and M. A. from Stanford University, a B. A. in Modern History at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, and completed his law degree at Yale Universi",Person

Freddy left real estate to pursue his passion for flying, working for Trans World Airlines, which gave him some good years. In 1962, at age 23, he married Linda Clapp, a stewardess. They had two children, whom they named Fred and Mary, after Freddy’s parents.

The family settled in Queens and spent free time with Freddy’s childhood best friend, William Drake, also a pilot, and his wife, Ms. Schifano.

In 1977, Donald asked Freddy to be the best man at his first wedding, to the Czech model Ivana Winklmayr. 

In 1999, the family patriarch died. Freddy’s son, Fred III, spoke at the funeral, and that night, his wife went into labor with their son, who developed seizures that led to cerebral palsy.

Since his election to Congress in 2002, Scott has burnished himself with a reputation as a leading advocate of tax relief and pro-growth economic policies, earning him awards and accolades from a number of national taxpayer and small business groups.

As a senior member of the House Budget Committee, Scott is on the frontline of House Republican efforts to rein in runaway government spending and shrink our country’s ballooning national debt.

A member of the House Financial Services Committee since his election to Congress (Financial Services Bio), Scott has been at the forefront of public policy deliberations dealing with issues related to the financial services industry, developing considerable expertise in areas ranging from securities and finance to insurance and regulatory oversight.

In this role, Scott presides over the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  In addition, the subcommittee also handles all matters related to capital markets activities such as business capital formation and venture capital, as well as derivative instruments.

As founder and Chairman of the Congressional Constitution Caucus, Scott is highly respected among his House colleagues as an authority on constitutional issues.  Founded in 2005, the Constitution Caucus provides an effective forum for education on constitutional principles and discussion on the appropriate limitations of congressional action.

He is a leading proponent of preserving open space and protecting such natural treasures as the Highlands, the Musconetcong River and the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge.

Prior to his election to Congress, Scott served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1990 to 2002, as the senior Assemblyman for the 24th Legislative District, Assistant Majority Leader, and Chairman of the Banking and Insurance Committee.

He also represents various non-profit organizations before state government. In addition, he provides advice and counsel on legal and regulatory matters to charter school organizations.
He began his professional career working for Representative John W. Wydler  on the professional staff of the Committee on Government Operations,  U.S. House of Representatives.  From 1983-86, he was Commissioner of the New York State Legislative Bill Drafting,  appointed by then state Senate Majority Leader Warren Anderson. The Commission is charged with the drafting and technical review of all bills and resolutions introduced into the state legislature.
Mr. Faso was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1986 and served as Minority Leader between 1998 and 2002. In the Assembly, he gained a reputation as a proponent of fiscal responsibility, lower taxes and budget reform.  Mr. Faso was also an early proponent of the establishment of charter schools and was the sponsor of the first legislative proposal to create a charter school law in New York State.  As Minority Leader, he was also instrumental in the passage of charter school legislation in 1998.
In 1994, Mr. Faso was asked by Governor-elect George E. Pataki to chair his budget transition team. In that capacity Faso supervised the staff of the state division of the budget in formulating the initial budget proposal on behalf of the newly elected Governor, closing a $5 billion deficit.  The budget that Faso prepared was the first New York State budget in 52 years to actually reduce spending on a year to year basis.  Mr. Faso became Ranking Minority Member of the Assembly Committee on Ways and Means and in 1998, was elected Minority Leader of the state Assembly. Mr. Faso stepped down as Minority Leader in  March, 2002 when he announced his candidacy for state Comptroller, an election he lost by a narrow margin. Mr. Faso was also the Republican candidate for Governor of New York in 2006.

"DAVID WILDSTEIN",144193,"David Wildstein, a former New Jersey Port Authority official who resigned last month, has been a fixture of New Jersey politics in various forms since at least age 23.

Wildstein, now 52, is a former town council member, mayor, political operative, anonymous political writer and founder of the respected site PolitickerNJ.com. He and Christie both attended Livingston High School, though Wildstein was a year ahead of Christie and the extent of their relationship then is unclear.

By 2010, Wildstein was brought on by a Christie appointee to serve as director of interstate capital projects for Port Authority, though Christie stressed in a press conference Thursday that the two rarely spoke during Wildstein’s tenure there.

But his time in New Jersey politics far predates the Port Authority post. Wildstein has long been considered a political animal and some have described him as ruthless: Reports last month indicated that he bought the domain names of more than 50 people, including many New Jersey Democrats.

His obsession with the game of politics began at an early age.

“I love this [political] stuff,” said one individual who worked closely with Wildstein, “He was psychotic about it, I could beat most people in political trivia; I couldn’t last with him for two minutes.”

At 23, Wildstein was elected to town council in Livingston, N.J., for a four-year term. During that period, he went on to become the city’s mayor, according to a lengthy 2012 profile in The Record (N.J.), which this week broke the bridge story.

“It was a tumultuous time,” Wildstein’s council running mate, Thomas L. Adams, told the paper. “He was just a kid, a very ambitious kid.”

Wildstein, who at age 12 volunteered for then-congressional candidate Tom Kean Sr., went on to work for several New Jersey politicians, including Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and the late Rep. Bob Franks (R-N.J.), the latter of whom he served as an adviser, the report noted.

He launched PolitickerNJ.com — then called PoliticsNJ.com — in 2000 under the pen name “Wally Edge,” named for a former New Jersey GOP governor and senator. Wildstein, burly and bespectacled, was known for getting insider information from politicos on both sides of the aisle.

“He was not a Christie-o-phile back then,” said the source who has worked closely with Wildstein, who is married with children.

“Wally Edge” was known for driving the New Jersey political conversation with frequent, sometimes flippant, posts.

“I’ve never met anybody … with more thorough institutional knowledge of New Jersey politics,” said Steve Kornacki, who got his start in journalism under Wildstein and now hosts a weekend show on MSNBC.

News of his identity shocked New Jersey politicos.

“After more than ten years covering New Jersey politics, it’s time for me to retire,” he wrote in a statement at the time. “Founding PolitickerNJ.com has been a tremendous journey, spanning six governors and seven statewide elections. New Jersey has an amazing political history, many talented (political) operatives, and a huge number of very good people.”","Director of Interstate Capital Projects",Position,"PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY",35403,NULL,Org

Just months after Pawlenty took office, the legislature adopted his plan to eliminate the deficit without raising taxes. In 2005, Governor Pawlenty balanced the state budget again without raising taxes. At the end of 2006, it was announced that under Pawlenty’s leadership, Minnesota’s $4.5 billion deficit had been transformed into a $2.2 billion surplus. 

 Besides bringing Minnesota from historic budget crisis to financial security, Pawlenty fought for and oversaw passage of a dramatic overhaul and improvement of the state's education standards; an $800 million increase in K-12 education spending along with a nation-leading teacher performance pay program; health care reforms that led to a zero percent premium increase in the state insurance program; significant welfare reform; tort liability reform; a range of new government efficiency initiatives; the creation of a nation-leading prescription drug website; and a doubling of the state's ethanol standard to increase use of renewable fuels and reduce dependence on foreign oil. 

 Pawlenty grew up in South St. Paul, Minnesota. The only child in his family to graduate from college, he attended the University of Minnesota and practiced law in the private sector. His public service career includes serving as a criminal prosecutor, Eagan City Councilmember, and ten-year member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, including four years as House Majority Leader.

Like many other immigrants, his father came to this country with little more than the shirt on his back. Abel's father believed that through hard work, his family could share the American Dream. As a child, Abel worked in the fields picking strawberries alongside his father to help support the family. The Maldonado family is a family of sacrifice, saving, planning, and investing for the future. After graduating from Santa Maria High School, Abel attended CSU Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, where he majored in Crop Science. Maldonado took the ideas he learned in college back to the small family farm. Because of his family's dedication and commitment to hard work, Abel Maldonado has seen that small farm grow from a half acre of strawberries into a farm that now works over 6,000 acres and employs over 250 people and ships produce all over the world.

Abel first ran for office because in 1994, the family farm applied for a building permit to erect a new 35,000 square foot cooling facility. After months of wading through the city's bureaucracy, he grew disillusioned with the lack of customer service that government had provided him, and he decided to run for City Council. So at the age of 26 Abel ran and was elected to the Santa Maria City Council. Two years later, he was elected Mayor by defeating the incumbent and a former Mayor. After guiding the city out of a financial crisis, Maldonado took his leadership style to Sacramento for the first time in 1998 when he was elected to the State Assembly. In the State Assembly, he made a commitment to his constituents to represent them to the best of his ability. He did so by priding himself on serving their needs before anything else.

Between 1972 and 1977, he served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft. Perry graduated from Texas A&M University in1972, where he was a member of the corps of cadets, a junior and senior yell leader, and an animal science major. From 1985 to 1991, he served in the Texas House of Representatives. Perry was elected commissioner of agriculture in 1990, and served two terms. As lieutenant governor, Perry worked with legislators to pass a balanced budget that included record tax cuts, teacher pay raises, and a historic school funding increase.

Perry was sworn in as the 47th governor of Texas on December 21, 2000, and was elected to a four-year term in November 2002. Perry has focused on   initiatives to improve education and the job climate, keep taxes low, and ensure disciplined state spending.  In 2003, he joined legislators of both parties in passing a balanced budget without a tax hike despite a $10 billion shortfall. This budget increased education and healthcare spending despite tough economic times, and invested in jobs with the new $295 million Texas Enterprise Fund. Perry also signed the nation's most sweeping lawsuit reforms to address skyrocketing malpractice insurance rates. Since the law's signing, hospitals and doctors have experienced insurance savings, and obstetricians and specialists are returning to practice in previously high-risk areas.

Through Perry's efforts, the number of children with health insurance under Medicaid and CHIP has more than doubled since 1999, and has increased by more than 100,000 since January 2003. He signed legislation allowing small businesses to pool together to offer affordable health insurance policies, and also reduced the number of mandates for private sector policies.  Perry's transportation plan, the Trans Texas Corridor, provides thousands of miles of new roads, new rail lines, and room for petroleum and electric lines, water lines and broadband technology. This proposal, along with new renewable energy requirements and emissions reduction legislation, will help clean the air in urban areas.  Perry's vision for school finance reform focuses on results-based incentives; cutting, capping and controlling property taxes; providing greater equity; and protecting the job climate. Perry is a lifetime member of American Legion Post #75 and  the Perrys are members of Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin. Perry and his wife Anita have two children.",Person

"WU XIAOHUI",231864,"Western media descriptions of Mr Wu, 49, often begin with his marriage to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the architect of modern China. 

Wu was not born into the political elite. Instead, according to local media accounts and insurance industry experts, he used his intelligence, good looks and business savvy to attract powerful patrons to fund a financial empire modelled on Warren Buffett.

Wu grew up in rural Pingyang county on the outskirts of Wenzhou, the famously entrepreneurial city in eastern Zhejiang province, according to the Chinese newspaper Southern Weekend. 

He served as a low-level bureaucrat in county government before heading to Wenzhou city where he initially drifted, working briefly as a purchasing manager for a restaurant.

While in Wenzhou, Mr Wu met the daughter of a powerful family, surnamed Lu, whose father had been vice governor of Zhejiang, according to financial magazine Caixin. Ms Lu became Mr Wu’s second wife.

His ascent in business began around the same time. In 1996 he launched an auto dealership licensed by SAIC Motors, China’s largest domestic automaker, which also has joint ventures with Volkswagen and General Motors. His company quickly became one of SAIC’s biggest sellers. Eight years later SAIC became one of the founding shareholders of Anbang, along with state-owned oil refiner Sinopec.

Anbang was launched in 2004 with only Rmb500m in registered capital and its headquarters in Ningbo, another city in Zhejiang where Southern Weekend says Mr Wu had family roots.

Wu’s marriage to Ms Lu also ended in 2004, and he married Deng’s granddaughter, whom Caixin has identified as named Zhuo Lian. Southern Weekend quoted an unnamed local official in Mr Wu’s home town saying that officials from Beijing came to Pingyang county to investigate Mr Wu’s background in advance of the marriage.",CEO,Position,"ANBANG INSURANCE GROUP",206460,"Anbang Insurance Group is a global insurance company with total assets of nearly 1971 billion RMB.
